    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated 4 times.\n",
    "- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated 7 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]\n",
    "Output: 11\n",
    "Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- n == nums.length\n",
    "- 1 <= n <= 5000\n",
    "- -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000\n",
    "- All the integers of nums are unique.\n",
    "- nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times."
